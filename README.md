# Abstract

As life grows to be fast-paced, the focus on good health habits and provisions on healthcare gets less evident among the people and communities. Busy work schedules often lead to delay or skipping of healthy meals and medication, which are supposed to be taken regularly on time. As more and more professionals have to move to different workplaces, their parents and families, especially the elderlies often face mobility problems, forget to take their medicines and even during emergency situations face problems to manage themselves due to lack of a personal support.

The conclusion is, it is absolutely normal for humans to make errors. But in a sensitive domain of healthcare, the margin of error should optimally be zero.

It was necessary to develop a system which could provide support to ensure that healthcare routines are followed during a busy schedule by providing hand-in-hand. Detecting and handling emergencies should also be a real-time priority of the system. The problem of affordability for a helping hand is also considered along with its reliability. Our study and research will be oriented around these mentioned fields.

For this system, a working model able to comply and address to all the mentioned limitations will be developed. The basic working principle will utilize various concepts of Robotics and Near-Human Intelligence based on computer vision, sensory data, geo-positioning &amp; artificial intelligence algorithms to solve the various problems.

_ **Near Intelligence &amp; Human-Like Capabilities:** _ One of the fundamental necessities of the system will be the ability to operate across a wide variety of challenging workspaces. Precision movements not limited only to movement but to interact with the user efficiently upon call or autonomously is a major priority of the system. The design goals of the [LX17] TRINA which was related to hospital mobility with light-to-medium duty tasks were studied. However, the system was controlled remotely by an operator console with a low-level command interface. The ability to turn a compact system into autonomous was kept in mind.

_ **Computer Vision &amp; Object Recognition:** _ An array of sensory feedback was required for this system with adequate programming. Collision detection [WANG18], limitation of path, and possible 3D Environment Map [LX17] could be useful for the system. User addressing system as well as extra vanity features for the domain of mental healthcare was also proposed.

_ **Medicine Dispensing and Time Management** _: Generally, to ensure good health and also, for patients recovering from an illness, the requirement to consume medicines on a scheduled routine is of vital importance. The ability to carry and dispense medicines [LX17], the ability to detect when quantity of stock is low and also to ensure easy programming by the user for restocking the items in an inbuilt storage system is necessary. The time management can be utilized by programming into the system once by an user through a WebGUI-based software running on the local network.

## Abstract

_ **Power Systems &amp; Electronics:** _ The system will be capable of carrying medium loads with a scale of economic factors in mind. Thereby, the mainboard requires custom application-specific design with embedded microcontrollers. A lead-acid battery will be adequate to power the motors that is proposed to be utilized. The system software will have an algorithm that will allow it to automatically notify the user and charge, while keeping alert of the surrounding. A standby mode will also be utilized to improve user runtime. The chassis heat management will be mitigated using custom cooling solutions.

_ **System Architecture:** _ A complete utilization of electronics, path-finding algorithms [FINA89] and IOT Subsystems and Advanced Sensors is proposed to be utilized. The system is for use in medical domain so deployment will be possible upon successful reliability and stress-testing across a multitude of different environments.

_ **Assistant &amp; User Interaction:** _ We have envisioned the system to interact with the user using limited voice-communication commands in real-time. The system will also be able to support the user&#39;s mental health with intelligent communications on demand. The system will also be able to spot abnormal events and report to a guardian registered on the system domain or health authorities, in case it detects the user to be in a difficult state, so as to ensure it remains valid for users of different age categories, preferable when deployed for a family.

_ **Project Objectives for the Current Semester:** _ The blueprint of the model, and the electronic requirements is targeted to be completed by this current semester. The system integration and PCB Design, chassis selection and development of TTL-controlled Power electronics section will be targeted for this time-period.
